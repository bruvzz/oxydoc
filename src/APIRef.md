# API Reference
Welcome to the reference page for Oxygen-U.

- Here, you will be able to see all of the supported functions Oxygen-U has in store.

- Before we start, here are some generics you should probably know when reading a function:

    - `union<T, X>` refers to functions that can return more then 1 type for that specific argument/return value.

    - `?` refers to optional parameters. Example: `<bool?>`

    - `<void>` refers to functions with no return results (as in other languages)

    - `variant` refers to parameters/return values that could be any type.

    - `...` refers to variable amounts of parameters/return values.
