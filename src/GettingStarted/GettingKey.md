## How to Get A Key:
When you first open Oxygen-U, you will be brought up with a small box.

- Inside of the box, you should have these 3 things:
    - The TextBox (`"Key Here"`)

    - Continue Button

    - Get Key Button

- Click the `Get Key` button.

- Once you have clicked the `Get Key` button, you will then go through a couple of Linkvertises.
    - This is to help monitize Oxygen-U.

    - Make sure you are going through `Free Access` when doing this process.

- Once you have finished, you will then be brought to the key screen.
    - Copy your key, then do `Ctrl + A` in the textbox inside Oxygen-U.

    - Delete the text that's already inside of the textbox.

    - Paste your key then click `Continue`.

Congratulations! You should now be authenticated and the user-interface should now be in front of you.
